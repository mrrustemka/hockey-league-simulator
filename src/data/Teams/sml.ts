      "Kalevankankaan jäähalli, also known as Let's Go Areena for sponsorship reasons, is a multipurpose indoor arena located in the Kalevankangas neighborhood in Mikkeli, Finland. The arena opened in 1982. Since 2016 the arena has been known with its sponsorship name Ikioma Areena, named after a local health care provider. In 2000 a practice rink was opened next to the arena. These two are the only indoor ice rinks in Mikkeli. The arena underwent a major renovation in 2011-13 when suites, restaurants, and an extended entrance area were added together with completely new dressing room areas. Some of the dressing rooms dated to the open air rink times and were completely outdated. The arena is part of the city's largest sport area which includes a multipurpose indoor arena Saimaa Stadium, a horse racing track Mikkelin Ravirata, a practice rink for ice sports, several football fields, tennis courts, badminton halls, dog training area, and several kilometers of running and cross-country skiing tracks.",
