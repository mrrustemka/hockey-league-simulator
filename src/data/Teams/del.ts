Along with a complete renovation the arena was closed for the DEL season 2013/14. The renovation had begun in 2010 and was scheduled to be completed in 2012. However, after the first stand had been completed, fans discovered that they were not able to see parts of the ice. The stand had to be rebuilt, causing an estimate of 2,5 million Euro extra cost and leading to a not yet settled lawsuit against the responsible architect.",
